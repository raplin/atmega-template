atmega-template
===============

ATmega avr-gcc template for simple projects.
Utterly uninteresting apart perhaps from slightly useful python tool,
which does console/uart I/O (so you can talk to your project) and quits/rebuilds as soon as you save your source file.

Generally meant to be a useful starting point for half-hour projects.

Requirements:
avrdude gcc-avr python
